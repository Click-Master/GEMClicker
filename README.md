# GEM Clicker

## Purpose
This repository is intended to share the auto clicker for the Gemlightyear P2E click game, so that you will not spend hours a day earning GEMs.

With this script, you will just log into your account once a day and watch(if you want) the progress.
Notes:
- the script artificially clicks with the delay to avoid reaching the hourly limits of 1000 GEMs
- it will reload your page automatically to reset the limits automatically
